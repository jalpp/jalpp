----------readme.md-----------------

I live to code, the day my Github shows all black for months and months Im probably dead. I don't commit for fun, my projects are not for fun they are the reason why I'm alive, those days I don't commit means I'm living a dead life, the days I commit means I'm dying to live.

You don't have to understand this README
