A loser who knows how to code useless things,

people only talk to me when they want something in return, so I stopped talking, and I started commiting, next year trying for 1 commit per day and fill the Github tiles because thats the only thing I can get good at. All other things I'm a loser and people make fun of me, and I laugh with them
